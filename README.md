IceCC (Iscript Code Compiler) is a program used to edit the image script 
file (iscript.bin) in Starcraft Broodwar.


To install, unzip icecc-1.3-win32.zip to any directory. It will 
create a folder called IceCC in that directory.

See the manual.pdf file for help. You will need adobe acrobat reader, which 
you probably already have, but, if not, you can download it from:

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html

If you want a more lightweight reader to view it with, you can download
foxit reader from:

http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php

If you want to use the Graphical User Interface (probably), then you need 
to install a Java Runtime Environment version 1.2 or greater. You may 
already have one. But if not, download it from Sun here:

http://java.com/getjava/

You can then run the IceCC program by double clicking the 'IceCCUI.BAT' 
file. You can create a short cut to it if you like.

The last version of IceCC from DI is available, along with source code,
at http://magnus99.dhs.org/downloads/ (now only available through
http://web.archive.org/). The newest version by ShadowFlare is available
at http://sfsrealm.hopto.org/ and the source code is available there
as well. Good luck!
