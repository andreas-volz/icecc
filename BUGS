* 06/09/02 jp - wow, lotsa memory leaks... probably should have added in memory
  usage profiling much earlier, but oh well. :)
* 06/08/02 jp - (MacOSX) for some reason from the GUI if we check 
  "Display all warnings" and compile a file with lots and lots of errors
  (e.g., some file that isn't even iscript text), the icecc process
  never returns (goes to sleep). The exact same command works perfectly
  from the command line, so I have no idea what is wrong, unless it's one of
  those impossible to find memory leaks that only causes problems once and
  a while... but no biggie, just make sure not to check that and it works
  fine all the time. FIXED
* 11/17/01 jp - On MacOSX, after fixing a bug in icecc.c (changed the
  table_instrname_to_num resource table to be initialized correctly with
  bytes instead of uint16's), I get a malloc error when running the
  program. Still seems to exit OK, but this is symtomatic of something
  being accessed after being freed which is not good and likely to cause
  a crash. It is probably related to this, but I don't have time to
  investigate at the moment. If you're using a big endian machine and
  icecc crashes, then this is a likely cause.
* 5/27/01 jp - On systems where data accesses must be word aligned 
  (such as SPARC), mread/mwrite will fail (you'll get a bus error).
  There are no plans at the moment to fix this. I don't think Starcraft
  will be ported to Solaris any time soon. ;)
