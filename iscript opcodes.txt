    * imgulnextid       0x3d - <x> <y> - displays an active image overlay at the shadow animation level at a specified offset position. The image overlay that will be displayed is the one that is after the current image overlay in images.dat.
    * __3e              0x3e - no parameters - unknown.
    * liftoffcondjmp    0x3f - <labelname> - jumps to a code block when the current unit that is a building that is lifted off.

    * orderdone         0x41 - <signal#> - most likely used with orders that continually repeat, like the Medic's healing and the Valkyrie's afterburners (which no longer exist), to clear the sigorder flag to stop the order.
    * grdsprol          0x42 - <sprite#> <x> <y> - spawns a sprite one animation level above the current image overlay at a specific offset position, but only if the current sprite is over ground-passable terrain.

    * dogrddamage       0x44 - no parameters - applies damage like domissiledmg when on ground-unit-passable terrain.
